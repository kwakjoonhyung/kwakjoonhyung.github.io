# About

## Hello World!  
  Hi, I'm Joonhyung Kwak.  
  Expected M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence at SKKU.  
  I'm mainly interested in Natural Language Processing, especially chatbots.  
  Also long-term memory in Large Language Models(LLM).  
  My goal is to build an AI system(chatbot) that can think and speak like a human.
